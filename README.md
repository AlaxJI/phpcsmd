phpcsmd
=======

Netbeans plugin to report code measurements generated by phpcs, phpmd, phpcpd
and pdepend as tasks and annotations.

Installation
============

 * open Tools -> Plugins and select the "Available Plugins" tab
 * search and install phpcsmd

-----------------------

 * Download and install the latest release from here http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/42434

-----------------------

 * check out this repository and open it with Netbeans
 * right click the project and select "Install/Reload in Development IDE"

-----------------------

Usage
=====

 * Open Tools->Options->PHP->PHPCSMD to configure the plugin
 * Open "Action Items" by pressing Ctrl + 6 and leave them open
 * You can scan files and folders by right clicking on the file/folder or source code and choose "Check for violations" or "Scan with Pdepend"
 * Right click on the PHP-Project and choose Properties -> PHPCSMD to set project specific settings

Tips
====

 * enable "try threading analysis" to prevent Netbeans from freezing during scan
 * enable "update on save" to rescan the file each time you save
 * enter "\.(svn|git)" (or any other regex) to prevent this files/folders from being scanned
 * if the "Action items" tab is open (Ctrl + 6) PHPCSMD will scan the file after Netbeans opened it
 * first configure the path to phpcs, click "show standards" and choose your favorite standard
   you can also enter a path to standard in the "--standard" option if your favorite standard is not installed in pear
 * enable "Use tabs to organize PdependReport" and "Create JDepend statistics" to get a better view on the metrics
 * Deactivate "Create JDepend statics" if you don't care about package abstraction/instability to increase the pdepend performance
 * activate PHPCPD folder scan to detect duplicated source code between your source files
   '''NOTE''': files with violations will be rescanned on save (if activated) until all phpcpd violations have been eliminated.


TODO 
====

The following features are planed to be implemented. Since phpcsmd is available
via github.org, feel free to contribute new features and bugfixes.

 * (done) Progressbar showing current scan progress
 * (done) Group violations in action items tab
 * (done) missing phpcpd violations under windows
   * have to check this fix under linux
 * Mark annotations in the left errorstripe
 * make phpcsmd scan the current file even if action items are not opened
 * add icons in the file navigation to indicate violations
 * make phpmd use different ruleset.xml
